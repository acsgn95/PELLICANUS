Pellicanus is an open source INS/GPS integrated navigation system designed to be a handy, accessible development board. It consists of 10 DOF IMUs, a GNSS receiver and a RP2040 processor. There are GPIO pins for sensor data input. By default, it includes the loosely coupled extended kalman filter and odometer. It gives you the systemâ€™s 3d vector velocity, 3d vector position, and orientation angles.

Pellicanus is not only a tactical level INS/GPS, it also comes with completely open source mathematical models, software and schematics. Also, the system sensitivity is at a level to compete with military systems on the market.

Pellicanus can be configured with only a few changes to fit where you want to install it. For example, it can be used in drones, unmanned land vehicles, agricultural systems, or even robotics.

# Navigation Algorithm
PELLICANUS includes loosely coupled EKF/NCF with discrete architecture. The architecture is as follows.

# GUI
We are working on a GUI where you can pull raw IMU data from PELLICANUS and edit them in various AHRS and Navigation programs.

# C Code
In the future, we will share the C driver of the Default Navigation Algorithm and the C code of the sensor drivers.
